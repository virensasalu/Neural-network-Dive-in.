# Neural-network-Dive-in.
# Neural Networks Exploration

## Overview
This project explores and implements fundamental neural network architectures and related techniques, focusing on the following topics:

1. **Backpropagation**: Understanding and implementing the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks.
2. **Feedforward Networks**: Creating and experimenting with feedforward neural networks for various tasks.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Developing RNNs for sequential data processing.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implementing CNNs for image and spatial data analysis.
5. **Strings to Vectors**: Converting text data into vector representations for use in machine learning models.

## Features
- Detailed implementation of backpropagation for training neural networks.
- Experiments with feedforward networks for classification and regression tasks.
- Sequential data processing using RNNs, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks.
